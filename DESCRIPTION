Description: We have developed the human disease ontology R package HDO.db, 
    which provides the semantic relationship between human diseases.
    Relying on the DOSE and GOSemSim packages we developed, we can carry out 
    disease enrichment and semantic similarity analyses. 
    Many biological studies are achieved through mouse models,  
    and a large number of data indicate the association between genotypes 
    and phenotypes or diseases.  The study of model organisms can be transformed 
    into useful knowledge about normal human biology and disease to 
    facilitate treatment and early screening for diseases. 
    Organism-specific genotype-phenotypic associations can be applied 
    to cross-species phenotypic studies to clarify previously unknown 
    phenotypic connections in other species. Using the same principle 
    to diseases can identify genetic associations and even help to 
    identify disease associations that are not obvious. Therefore, 
    as a supplement to HDO.db and DOSE, we developed mouse phenotypic 
    ontology R package MPO.db.
