\description{
    This data set describes associations between MPO
    terms and their ancesto terms, based on the directed acyclic
    graph (DAG) defined by the Mouse Phenotype Ontology Consortium.
    The format is an R
    object mapping the MPO terms to all ancestor terms, where an
    ancestor term is a more general MPO term that precedes
    the given MPO term in the DAG (in other words, the parents, and all
    their parents, etc.).
}
\details{
    Each MPO    term is mapped to a vector of ancestor MPO    terms.
    Mappings were based on data provided by: Mouse Phenotype Ontology
    With a date stamp from the source of: 20230302
